LPC15xx Clock output example

Example description:
--------------------
This example shows how to use the SYSCTL driver to driver a specific
clock source on the CLKOUT pin. To use this example, you'll need to
connect an oscilloscope to the CLKOUT pin on your board. On the NXP
LPCXpresso this is GPIO1_0.  It can be probed at J1 pin 9.
On the KEIL MCB1500 this is also GPIO1_0.  It can be probed on the prototyping
header PORT1 pin 1.

Special connection requirements:
--------------------------------
There are no special connection requirements for this example.
